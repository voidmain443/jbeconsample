    "\n",
    "1. Understand how economics functions as a social science through the application of the **scientific method**.  \n",
    "2. Analyze the process of **abstraction** in economic modeling and the logical necessity of assumptions.  \n",
    "3. Examine **incentives** as the fundamental driver of economic behavior and the mechanics of unintended consequences.  \n",
    "4. Distinguish between **causation** and **correlation** and identify common empirical pitfalls.  \n",
    "5. Differentiate between **positive** and **normative** analysis and define the dual role of the economist.\n",

    "## **2.1 Economics as a Social Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "Economics is the study of how individuals and societies allocate scarce resources. While the subject matter—human behavior and social institutions—is inherently complex and volatile compared to the physical world, economists employ a **scientific methodology** to analyze these phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1.1 The Cycle of Scientific Inquiry**\n",
    "\n",
    "The investigative process in economics follows a rigorous cycle similar to that of the natural sciences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observation:** Identifying patterns or anomalies in the real world (e.g., \"Why does consumption fluctuate with interest rate changes?\").  \n",
    "2. **Theoretical Formulation:** Developing a logical framework or hypothesis to explain the observed phenomena.  \n",
    "3. **Empirical Testing:** Utilizing statistical data or experimental methods to determine if the hypothesis holds under scrutiny. If the data contradicts the theory, the model is revised or discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\<Table 2-1\\> Comparative Methodology: Natural Science vs. Social Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Natural Science (e.g., Physics) | Social Science (e.g., Economics) |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- | :---- |\n",
    "| **Subject Matter** | Matter, Energy, Cells (Controllable) | Humans, Markets, Institutions (Complex) |\n",
    "| **Experimental Mode** | Controlled Laboratory Experiments | Observational Data & Natural Experiments |\n",
    "| **Nature of Laws** | Universal / Absolute (e.g., Gravity) | Probabilistic / Conditional (e.g., Demand) |\n",

    "## **2.2 Economic Models: Maps for a Complex World**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2.1 Abstraction and the Paradox of the Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world is staggeringly complex, involving billions of agents and an infinite number of variables. To make sense of this, economists use **Economic Models**—simplified representations of reality designed to highlight essential relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Map Analogy:** A driver traveling from Seoul to Busan does not require a map detailing every tree or the color of every building. A simplified schematic showing highways and exits is far more functional.  \n",
    "* **The Essence of Modeling:** The goal of a model is not to be a perfect replica of reality but to provide **explanatory power**. By removing \"noise\" through **abstraction**, we can focus on the causal link between variables of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2.2 The Logical Necessity of Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a model requires \"freezing\" parts of reality through **assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homo Economicus (Rational Agent):** The assumption that individuals act to maximize their own utility or profit. While humans are not always perfectly rational, this assumption provides a powerful baseline for predicting aggregate market behavior.  \n",
    "* **Ceteris Paribus:** A Latin phrase meaning **\"all other things being equal.\"** This logical device allows economists to isolate the pure effect of one variable (e.g., price) on another (e.g., quantity demanded) by assuming all other influential factors remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[Box 2-1\\] Milton Friedman’s \"Billiard Player\" Analogy** Milton Friedman argued that the \"realism\" of assumptions is less important than a model's predictive power. An expert billiard player may not know the formal laws of physics, but he acts *as if* he understands them perfectly. Similarly, even if individuals aren't perfectly rational calculators, a model assuming they are can still accurately predict market outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.3 The Science of Incentives: How Humans Respond**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of economic reasoning is the principle that **individuals respond to incentives**. An incentive is a reward or punishment that motivates behavior. Prices, taxes, and laws are all forms of incentives that redirect human action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.1 Perverse Incentives and Unintended Consequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "When policy designers fail to account for the sophisticated ways agents respond to incentives, they often encounter **unintended consequences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Cobra Effect:** In colonial India, the government offered a bounty for dead cobras to reduce their population. In response, citizens began breeding cobras to collect the bounty. When the program was scrapped, the breeders released the snakes, leaving the cobra population higher than before.  \n",
    "* **The Peltzman Effect:** Mandating seatbelts made drivers feel safer, leading them to drive more recklessly. The resulting increase in accidents involving pedestrians offset the gains in driver safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.4 Empirical Pitfalls: Correlation vs. Causation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most significant challenge in modern economics is identifying true **causation** within mountains of data. Observing that two variables move together (**correlation**) does not mean one causes the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4.1 Omitted Variable Bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "This occurs when a third, unobserved factor influences both variables under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\<Table 2-2\\> Common Errors in Data Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Error Type | Observation (Correlation) | Erroneous Interpretation | True Causal Analysis |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n",
    "| **Omitted Variable** | High ice cream sales correlate with drowning. | Ice cream consumption causes drowning. | **High Temperature** increases both swimming and ice cream sales. |\n",
    "| **Reverse Causality** | High police presence correlates with high crime. | Police cause crime. | **High-crime areas** require a larger police presence for safety. |\n",
    "| **Selection Bias** | Hospital patients have higher mortality rates. | Hospitals are dangerous places. | Only **sick individuals** (pre-selected) go to the hospital. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4.2 Natural Experiments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since economists cannot often perform randomized lab trials, they look for **Natural Experiments**—accidental occurrences in history that create a \"control\" and \"treatment\" group. A classic example is the study by Card and Krueger (1994), which compared employment in fast-food restaurants on either side of the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border after NJ raised its minimum wage while PA did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.5 Positive vs. Normative Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists play two distinct roles, distinguished by the nature of their statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positive Statements (Descriptive):** Claims about how the world **is**. These are scientific and can be tested or refuted using data.  \n",
    "   * *Example: \"A 10% increase in the money supply will lead to a long-term rise in the price level.\"*  \n",
    "2. **Normative Statements (Prescriptive):** Claims about how the world **ought to be**. These are based on value judgments, ethics, and political philosophy.  \n",
    "   * *Example: \"The government should limit money supply growth to ensure price stability for the poor.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "## **\\[Data Project\\] Escaping the Correlation Trap**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 1: Identifying Latent Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the following hypothetical data from the nation of 'Econonia.'\n",
    "\n",
    "| Month | Ice Cream Sales ($M) | Drowning Incidents | Avg. Temperature (°C) |\n",
    "| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n",
    "| January | 1.2 | 0 | 2.5 |\n",
    "| April | 4.5 | 2 | 15.2 |\n",
    "| August | 12.8 | 15 | 28.5 |\n",
    "| November | 2.1 | 1 | 8.3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe the correlation between Ice Cream Sales and Drowning Incidents.  \n",
    "2. If the government taxes ice cream to \"prevent drowning,\" why would this policy fail?  \n",
    "3. Define the role of 'Temperature' in this data set using the term **Omitted Variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 2: Spurious Correlations in the Real World**\n",
    "\n",
    "Visit the website *Spurious Correlations* by Tyler Vigen. Select one graph showing a high correlation (e.g., Per capita cheese consumption vs. deaths by bedsheet entanglement). Explain why a policymaker who treats this as causation would make a catastrophic error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Terms (Glossary)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** The process of simplifying complex reality into manageable models.  \n",
    "* **Ceteris Paribus:** The assumption that all other relevant factors are held constant.  \n",
    "* **Omitted Variable:** A hidden factor that causes a spurious relationship between two other variables.  \n",
    "* **Positive Economics:** The study of \"what is\" through objective, empirical analysis.  \n",
    "* **Natural Experiment:** An observational study where variables are determined by nature or policy changes rather than a researcher."
